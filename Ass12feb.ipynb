    "'''An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. Exceptions are raised when an error occurs during the execution of a program. This can be due to various reasons, such as trying to divide a number by zero, accessing an index in a list that doesn't exist, or trying to open a file that doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is raised, the normal flow of the program is interrupted, and Python tries to find an exception handler, which is a block of code that can handle the exception and allow the program to continue executing. If no exception handler is found, the program will terminate and display an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "A syntax error, on the other hand, occurs when the code written by the programmer is not valid according to the syntax rules of the Python language. It occurs before the code is executed, when Python is trying to parse the code. Syntax errors are usually indicated by error messages that point to a specific line of code where the error occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main difference between an exception and a syntax error is that exceptions occur during the execution of the code, while syntax errors occur when the code is being parsed and before it is executed.'''"
